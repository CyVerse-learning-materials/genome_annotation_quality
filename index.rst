**Evaluate Genome Annotation Quality in Discovery Enviornment and JetStream**
=============================================================================


Introduction
-------------

    The first human genome was sequenced at a cost of $2.7 billion. Today, after only 20 years, a "high-quality" genome can be generated for about $1000, and the innovation in genome-sequencing technologies and strategies does not appear to slow down. As a result, we continue to see booms in the number of sequenced and annotated genomes. Generating a high-quality genome annotations is a complex and challenging problem. As genome annotations are dynamic and an iterative process, tools to track quality of annotated genomes from release-to-release and iteration-to-iteration are badly required. In this tutorial, we are using GenomeQC that provides a comprehensive summary of genome annotation statistics and allows for benchmarking against gold standard reference annotations (Manchanda et al., 2019). GenomeQC can be used both as an app in the DE and WQ-MAKER on JetStream.

Goal
-----

    


    This tutorial is a work in progress, we will keep integrating more tools in DE for comparing and measuring quality of annotated genomes.
